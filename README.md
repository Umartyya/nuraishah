A simple love letter for my wife on her birthday.

## Background

She wanted a diamond. But I told her diamonds are a cartel-controlled, common gemstone. So I told her if she got me a MacBook, I'll get her a ruby instead.

She got me a MacBook.

Since I very well can't afford a ruby, I can only give her the only other ruby which I find to be just as beautiful as her, the Ruby language.
